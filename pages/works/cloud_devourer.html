                    This piece is a summary of a view, where a billow of clouds just ever so slightly hug the mountain's peak. When this occured to me I was not asked to think of as to whether the clouds were heavy and low, or if the gentle spires are those worthy of awe. Instead what was conjured upon me was a scene of eruption, the instance where that of the earth's deepest, through the mouth of a giant, was given the chance to disturb the order of the heavens and desecrate its authority; the permission to unleash smoke, shadows, and dust so dense that it summoned thunder on the faces of the gods.
